        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

This is achieved by integrating the attention value into the task. [...] Attention mechanisms have provided and will provide a paradigm shift in machine learning. Specifically, this change is from traditional large-scale vector transformations to more conscious processes (i.e., that focus only on a set of elements), e.g., decomposing a problem into a sequence of attention based reasoning tasks [13,30,31,32,33,34]. [...] Attention mechanisms have provided and will provide a paradigm shift in machine learning [11,12]. These mechanisms allow a model to focus only on a set of elements and to decompose a problem into a sequence of attention based reasoning tasks . Moreover, they can be applied to model complex systems in a flexible and promising way.
